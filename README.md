# Document Similarity 

Document similarity measures are basis the several downstream applications in the area of natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR). 

### Sentence-level

- ERCNN: Enhanced Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks for Learning Sentence Similarity 

### BERT and other Transformer Language Models

- BERT 
- GPT 
- Generative Pre-Training-2 (GPT-2) 
- Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT) 
- XLNet
- Reformer
